<p style="text-align:center;background-color: aliceblue;" > After reading this article I couldn't help but think about all we accomplished which the author had predicted. He forsaw the most outragous steps of scientific development since the date it was published. 
    I tried my best to compare what he was predicting to what we have today. At the time in 1945 when this was published, science and technology had improved communication and knowledge on its own. The post-war success proved to only reach some scholars while others were left in the dark. 
    It seems he basically concived the idea of the internet by asking that humans find a way to share the information we colletively know with others. Its interesting to see all of the other technoilogical inventions he talks about as well.</p>
